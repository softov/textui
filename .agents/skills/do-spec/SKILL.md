description: Create and maintain the `.project/ artifacts` that let an agent understand what a project is building, why each decision was made, which rules hold, which problems are open, what has been implemented, and what work remains, so the record survives across agents and sessions. Use when writing, amending or closing a plan, task, decision, problem, spec, rule, research note or implementation record, when moving a task's status, and when templates, paths, references, statuses and cross-links must stay consistent.

# Writing `.project/ artifacts` files

`.project/` holds what the project is building and why. `.agents/` holds only skills.
Start every file from its template in `assets/`; the template says what goes in each field and section. Replace every `<placeholder>`, delete what you do not fill.

| Kind | Template | Path |
|---|---|---|
| plan | [plan.md](assets/plan.md) | `.project/plans/<domain>/<NN>-<slug>/plan.md` |
| task | [task.md](assets/task.md) | same folder, `task-<NN>-<slug>.md` |
| implemented | [implemented.md](assets/implemented.md) | same folder, `implemented.md` |
| deferred | [deferred.md](assets/deferred.md) | same folder, `deferred.md` |
| domain reference | [domain.md](assets/domain.md) | `.project/plans/<domain>/00-<domain>.md` |
| spec | [spec.md](assets/spec.md) | `.project/specs/<slug>.md` |
| rule | [rule.md](assets/rule.md) | `.project/rules/<slug>.md` |
| decision | [decision.md](assets/decision.md) | `.project/decisions/<slug>.md` |
| problem | [problem.md](assets/problem.md) | `.project/problems/<slug>.md` |
| research | Markdown with a `title` | `.project/research/<slug>.md` |

`.project/plans/index.md` is the entry: one row per plan, kept by hand.

## Conventions

- Frontmatter on every file; `title` always. Slugs are kebab-case; only plans and tasks carry a number.
- A path is an identity: nothing is moved or deleted; what no longer applies gets a `status`. A problem is the one exception: it is deleted once it becomes plan work.
- Paths in frontmatter are relative to `.project/`, except a task's `depends`, which names sibling task files.
- `refs` say where something is, never its state, one per line as `<uri> - <one line on why it is here>`. A ref is a URI: `code://<path>#L<n>-L<m>`, `npm://<package>@<range>`, `git://<sha|branch|tag>`, `tasker://<instance>:<project>#<id>`, `https://...`, `file://...`. A plan's files read and patterns to reuse are its refs; nothing lists them twice.
- A `code://` ref is local code, so write it as a Markdown link: keep the URI as the link text and make the target the same path relative to the file you are writing. In a decision at `.project/decisions/`, that is `[code://packages/papo/src/chat.ts#L51](../../packages/papo/src/chat.ts#L51)`. The text keeps the URI searchable and the target makes it clickable in a Markdown view. In a body, the same link reads better with the URI in a code span: ``[`code://<path>`](../../<path>)``.
- Quote the whole ref in frontmatter, because a list item that starts with `[` is YAML flow sequence syntax: `- "[code://packages/papo/src/chat.ts#L51](../../packages/papo/src/chat.ts#L51) - the configured default"`. Escape a `"` in the note as `\"`.
- The target carries one `../` per level between the file's folder and the repository root: four from `.project/plans/<domain>/<NN>-<slug>/`, three from `.project/plans/<domain>/00-<domain>.md`, two from `.project/specs/`, `.project/rules/`, `.project/decisions/`, `.project/problems/`, `.project/research/`.
- Only `code://` is linked; `npm://`, `git://`, `tasker://`, `https://` and `file://` stay bare, because they are not files in this repository. Never link a path the repository does not have yet, such as a `CREATE:` entry or a spec named in `creates`.
- Globs (`applies`, `covers`) are relative to the repository root.
- One full sentence per line in prose. Never an em dash.

## Statuses

- plan: `draft` `planned` `active` `built` `dropped`
- task: `todo` `doing` `done` `blocked` `dropped`
- decision: `proposed` `accepted` `deprecated` `superseded`
- problem: `open` `mitigated`
- rule: `active` `retired` · spec: `current` `retired`

## Plans

A plan is a folder: `plan.md`, one task file per task, and two files whose presence is their meaning:

- `implemented.md` exists when the plan is built: what exists now, what was verified, where it departed from the plan.
- `deferred.md` exists when the plan set something aside: what waits, why, where it goes.

`plan.md` is forward-action-only: the decision now and its source, never how it changed.
Anything not in *Decisions locked in* is undecided; a fork met during a task means stop, ask, amend the table.
A task's status moves in its own file and in the plan's *Tasks* table in the same change; the plan's *Resume state* and `index.md` move with it.
A plan that spans more than two packages or about eight tasks is a parent whose *Tasks* table lists child plans (`<NN>-<slug>-p<N>-<slug>/`).

To close a plan: every task `done` or `dropped`, `implemented.md` written, `deferred.md` written if anything waits, `status: built`, specs in `changes` and `creates` corrected, the index row updated.

## Decisions, rules, specs

- A decision that replaces another is a new file with `supersedes`; the old one gets `status: superseded` and `superseded-by`, body untouched; rules and specs that pointed at the old one move to the new one unless the old rationale still holds.
- Every decision is a file in `.project/decisions/` from the moment it is made; no file, no decision. A plan's *Decisions locked in* table only links them (`[<title>](../../../decisions/<slug>.md)`) and a row without a file is not a decision. The file names its source: the user's answer with the question quoted, a `code://` line, or `(defaulted: ...)` when the writer chose and the user may erase it.
- A decision records a choice a later reader would find strange: why it was made that way. It needs a fork (two options that both work, the rejected one named in `Options`), and it binds every later session. A choice anyone would make, a fix, a gap against a reference, a spec requirement or scope is not a decision: it is a task, with its source as a row in the plan's second table under *Decisions locked in* (`What | Source | Task`).
- A problem is something wrong that nobody has decided what to do about: a defect, a limitation, an obstacle met while working. It is a file in `.project/problems/` while it is undecided, and it binds nothing. Once the fix is decided, it is plan work: the task carries the fix, the answer that chose it is a row in the plan's second table, and the problem file is deleted. A problem accepted as it is becomes a decision if the choice is strange, and is deleted either way. The aim is no problem files.
- Only the user writes rules. An agent never creates, edits or retires a rule; it tells the user when something looks like one.
- A rule restating another is removed, not added. To retire one: `status: retired` and one line at the top saying why.
- A spec is corrected in place when behaviour changes; if the change contradicts a listed decision, a new decision comes first.

## Before writing

1. Read `.project/plans/index.md` and the domain's `00-<domain>.md`.
2. Check the thing does not already exist; amend rather than duplicate.
3. Find the refs: the code, package, commit or document it came from.

## Finding what `.project/` already says about a file

The `refs` are the index: every plan, task, decision, rule and spec names the code it is about as `code://<path>`, so the way to find what has been decided or planned for a file is to search `.project/` for its path. The link text keeps `code://<path>`, so these searches match a ref whether it was written as a link or left bare.

- Everything about one file: `rg -n "code://packages/agents/src/run/tools.ts" .project/` (drop the `#L...` so a ref with line numbers still matches).
- Everything about a package or folder: `rg -n "code://packages/agents/src/run/" .project/`.
- The decisions only: `rg -ln "code://packages/agents/src/run/tools.ts" .project/decisions/`.
- What is open against it: `rg -ln "code://packages/agents/src/run/" .project/problems/`.
- Which plan a decision belongs to: `rg -n "decisions/<slug>.md" .project/plans/`.
- A decision by number or subject when the slug is unknown: `rg -n "^title: 116 " .project/decisions/` or `rg -ln -i "deny" .project/decisions/`.

Do this before proposing a change to a file, before writing a decision about it, and when a comment in the code cites a decision number that no plan on disk explains any more.

## Finishing

- No `<placeholder>` left. Every frontmatter path and every relative link resolves (`creates` may name a spec not yet written).
- Every `status` is one of the values above for its kind.
- `index.md` has the row and the status.
