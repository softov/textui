# chat

An agent chat client, as an application: a catalogue of sessions on a host, a
conversation that streams, and the block that appears when the agent stops and
waits for a person.

```bash
pnpm example chat                       # run it
pnpm example chat --static --width 100  # one frame, to stdout
pnpm example chat --tick 15             # stream faster
pnpm example chat --shell paper --theme paper-dark   # the same screens, elsewhere
```

The shell and the theme are a starting point rather than a fixture: `ctrl+t`
changes the theme while it runs and the palette has both, previewing each as
the highlight moves. Nothing in `view/` names a border style or a glyph - they
come from the theme, which is what lets the same graph render under an ascii
console and an airy borderless page.

It exists to answer one question: **which components does a chat application
need that the catalog does not have?** The answer is at the bottom, and it is
shorter than it looks - two components are genuinely missing, one is missing
and needed by everything, and the rest is composition.

## What it talks to

[AHP](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-host-protocol/), the Agent Host
Protocol, as Advisor speaks it. An agent host is a *sessions server*: several
clients watch and drive the same sessions and none of them owns the process
running the agent. That shape is why this is not "a chat UI with a backend" -
every send is a fire-and-forget dispatch, the turn appears when the host has
reduced it, and somebody else may be answering the same question in an editor
on another machine while you look at it.

`src/ahp/` is the protocol as a client reads it, and `HostConnection` is the
seam. `fakeHost` implements it with a scripted agent, which is what lets the
example run and be tested with nothing installed; a real client implements the
same interface over a WebSocket and nothing above it changes.

Time in the fake is a `pump`, not a timer: the application drives it from an
interval and the test calls it in a loop, so the streaming path is what gets
exercised rather than a fixture that arrived all at once.

## Layout

```
src/
  ahp/          the protocol: types, the status bitset, the connection, a scripted host
  blocks.ts     a conversation → the entries a feed scrolls. No rendering
  state.ts      the store paths, and the fold from host action to store write
  control.ts    the controller, the commands, the keybindings
  view/         the components, and nothing else
  screens.tsx   which component goes where
  app.tsx       registration: components, screens, surfaces
  main.tsx      the terminal, the quit key, and the clock
```

The split that matters is `control.ts` against `view/`. They change for
different reasons: a new screen is a rendering change, and answering a new kind
of request is a change in control. Written as one file, a small protocol change
touches every component that draws a bubble.

`blocks.ts` is pure for the same reason - it is where a bug is a wrong *value*
rather than a wrong picture, and a test for it needs no terminal.

## The screens

Six, and each is a different question.

| | Screen | Is | Reached by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sessions` | The catalogue: what is running, what is waiting on you, what errored | opens here, `esc` |
| 2 | `chat` | One conversation: transcript, the block that waits, the composer | `enter` on a row |
| 3 | `new` | Harness, model, thinking level, workspace, first message | `n`, `ctrl+n` |
| 4 | `changes` | What the session changed on disk, from the changeset channel | `c` |
| 5 | `settings` | The session's own config schema, and what may be changed while it runs | `s` |
| 6 | `hosts` | Which host, whether it is answering, what it advertises | palette |

Everything else that came up is **not** a screen:

- the **command palette** and a **confirm** are layers - over a screen, belonging to none;
- a **tool call's output** expands in place, because it is part of the row it belongs to;
- the **block that waits** is inside the chat screen, between the transcript and the composer, where it cannot scroll away and cannot be typed past.

Only `chat` is `keepAlive`. Coming back from the changes list to a conversation
that had scrolled itself to the top is losing your place in a document that is
still being written.

## The keys

Two tiers, and the split is not cosmetic.

**Modified keys are global** because nothing types them. **Single letters are
scoped to a screen**, because on the conversation screen `d` is a letter in a
word and on the catalogue it disposes a session.

The runtime already offers a key to the focused node before any keybinding, so
a letter typed into the composer is a letter - that is the mechanism, and it is
why there is no `q` for quit anywhere. A quit key that works only where nothing
happens to be reading it is not a quit key.

| Everywhere | |
|---|---|
| `ctrl+p` | commands |
| `ctrl+c` | stop the turn you are watching - or quit, when there is none |
| `ctrl+n` | new session |
| `ctrl+r` | refresh the catalogue |
| `ctrl+q` | quit |
| `ctrl+t` | theme |
| `esc` | out of the composer first, then back a screen |

| On the catalogue | |
|---|---|
| `↑ ↓` | move · `enter` open |
| `n` `r` | new · refresh |
| `a` `x` | archive / unarchive · show archived |
| `u` | mark read / unread — opening a session marks it read on its own |
| `d` | dispose (asks first) |
| `/` | into the filter |
| `tab` | into the detail pane: `↑ ↓` walks it, `enter` copies the row |

| In a conversation | |
|---|---|
| `i` | write - into the composer |
| `esc` | back out of the composer, into the transcript |
| `↑ ↓` `j` `k` | move the cursor between blocks |
| `enter` `space` | expand what the cursor is on |
| `pgup` `pgdn` | scroll · `g` top · `G` follow the tail |
| `f` | stop following / follow again |
| `c` `s` | changes · settings |
| `t` | stop the turn |

| In the composer | |
|---|---|
| `enter` | send - or queue, while a turn is running |
| `alt+enter`, `ctrl+j` | a newline. Not `shift+enter`: most terminals cannot tell it from `enter` |
| `↑` at the top | the last thing you sent |
| `/` at the start | commands |

| While the agent is waiting | |
|---|---|
| `a` `d` | approve · deny — *a confirmation only* |
| `1`-`9` | a named option, by number: option ids are opaque and a live host sends whole sentences as ids |
| `tab` `space` | move between questions · choose — *a question only* |
| `enter` | send the answers, from the Send button |
| `esc` | give the keyboard back without answering |

A question is not a confirmation, and the hint row says so: offering "a
approve" over an elicitation is the same mistake as rendering one as the other,
made in the row that exists to explain it.

## What this needed that the catalog does not have

Writing it turned up three things that were missing, and they are **now in
`@textui/core`** - this example imports them like anything else.

| In core | Why it was not a composition |
|---|---|
| [`Feed`](../../packages/core/src/ui/data.ts) | `List` is fixed-height rows with a selection; `ScrollView` is a viewport that knows nothing about its contents. A conversation needs both at once: entries whose height is whatever the text wrapped to, a cursor that moves between them, and a tail it follows until the reader scrolls away. Heights are **measured and reported upward**, because what a paragraph wraps to is the layout's decision. Nothing about it is chat - a transcript, an activity stream, results with snippets and a diff whose files expand are the same component. |
| [`TextArea`](../../packages/core/src/ui/control.ts) | `TextInput` is one line. A message is a paragraph with a path in it: it has to grow, take a newline that is not a send, walk a history, and hand back the keys it does not want. |
| [`MarkdownView`](../../packages/core/src/ui/data.ts) + [`layoutMarkdown`](../../packages/core/src/util/markdown.ts) | Everything a host writes for a person is markdown. There was already a renderer inside `@textui/documents`, and it threw the emphasis away - correct for a README viewer, wrong for prose where **bold** is meaning. The layout is now one pure function in core with styled runs; `MarkdownView` paints it, and `MarkdownViewer` in `documents` windows the same rows and gained emphasis, inline code and links by doing so. |

`TextInput` and `TextArea` also take a `focusId` now, which is what lets `/`
mean "focus the filter": without one, a control's id comes from its instance
and a command has nothing to name.

**Still in this example, and probably application-shaped:** `ChatBubble`,
`StreamingText`, `ReasoningBlock`, `ToolCallRow`, `ChatComposer`, `ChatHitl`
and its `ConfirmRequest`/`QuestionForm`, `ChatTranscript`, `SessionList`,
`ChangesList`, `ConnectionBadge`, `Gutter`. Every one is a composition of what
the catalog ships - `ChatTranscript` is a `Feed` and a switch on the block
kind, and the composer is a `TextArea` and a row of ghost buttons. The useful
finding is that they *are* compositions, and that the vocabulary they share is
a gutter, a status glyph and a tone.

**Used unchanged, and enough:** `List` for the catalogue - rows are one line
and the height does not depend on the content, which is exactly what a
transcript is not - plus `Panel`, `Row`/`Column`, `RadioGroup`, `Checkbox`,
`TextInput`, `Select`, `SearchBox`, `KeyValue`, `Badge`, `EmptyState`,
`KeyHints`, `CommandPalette`, `confirm()`, and `Button` - including
`variant="ghost"`, which is what the composer's action row is made of.

A fourth, which is still here rather than in core:
[`SessionDetails`](src/view/details.tsx) - a property list you can walk and
copy a value out of. `KeyValue` draws the same pairs and is static, so nothing
selects a row: a URI cannot be read in full and cannot be pasted anywhere. The
selected row is the one that gets the room - every other row truncates to one
line, the selected one wraps - which costs nothing when the value is short and
is the whole answer when it is a URI in a 40-column pane.

**Still missing, and known:**

- the composer's action row truncates below ~80 cells rather than dropping labels for glyphs. It needs `breakpoints`, which the primitives have and this does not use yet.
- `1`-`9` does not answer a *question*, only a confirmation, because the same keys are letters in its freeform field. Numbering a question's options needs the field to say when it does not want a digit.
- a tool call with four hundred lines of output expands to four hundred rows. `CodeViewer` is the right thing inside the row, and the row has to stop being as tall as its content for that to work.

## Findings worth keeping

**A fixture that lies reads as a bug in the client.** The scripted host used to
assign each seeded session a status by hand, and one of them claimed
`InputNeeded` while holding no pending input. Opening the row that said
"waiting on you" showed a conversation with nothing to answer - which is
indistinguishable from a client that drops the request when you leave the
screen, and was debugged as one. The status is now *derived* from what the host
is actually holding, so it cannot disagree with it.

**One canned reply proves only that the client can render that reply.** Every
session opening on the same transcript and every message getting the same
answer hides everything that only goes wrong on prose of another shape. The
scripted agent now has four: a short answer with no tool calls, a command that
asks before it runs, a question, and a failure - chosen from what was said, so
a person driving the example can pick one.

**A trap is not the same as focus.** The block that waits on a person took the
focus *and trapped it*, on the reasoning that answering is the only thing to
do. But you approve a command on the strength of what is written above it, so
the transcript has to stay readable - and the trap also swallowed the escape
the block itself advertises, which is why a blocked session could not be left
without answering it. It autofocuses and does not trap; the keys that answer it
are global, so they still work from wherever the reader has gone.

**A running turn is not in the history.** `ChatState.turns` is the completed
turns; the one in flight is `activeTurn`. A client that renders only `turns`
shows an empty conversation for exactly as long as somebody is watching one
happen.

**Prose and tool calls are one ordered stream.** Splitting them apart puts
every sentence at the top and every command at the bottom, and the sentence
explaining a command ends up fifteen rows above it.

**Status is two things in one number.** `InputNeeded` is 24 and carries
`InProgress`, so it has to be tested first - otherwise the one session that
wants a person reads as merely running.

**A question carries no tool call.** Its prose is the request's message, and
what is being asked is its questions. Read as a confirmation, the choices
vanish and what is left on screen is a heading and an Approve button.

**Accepting with no answers resumes the agent on the answers it already had**,
which for a question it has just asked is none. So a required question that is
unanswered is not sendable.

## What to look at first

[`src/view/hitl.tsx`](src/view/hitl.tsx), for the two kinds of waiting and why
they are not one; then [`src/control.ts`](src/control.ts), which is every
action the application has in one list; then
[`src/view/transcript.tsx`](src/view/transcript.tsx), which is now short enough
to read in a sitting because the viewport underneath it moved into the catalog.

The measure-report-scroll loop itself is in
[`Feed`](../../packages/core/src/ui/data.ts) - that is where to look for "how
tall did that turn out to be", which is the question anything with entries of
mixed height has to answer.
