/**
 * What a chat client needs from an agent host.
 *
 * A host is a *sessions server*: several clients watch and drive the same
 * sessions and none of them owns the process running the agent. So everything
 * here is either a question about state the host owns, or a fire-and-forget
 * dispatch - there is no local "send and append what I sent". The turn appears
 * when the host has reduced it, which is why the UI re-reads rather than
 * echoing.
 *
 * This is the seam. `fakeHost` implements it with a scripted agent so the
 * example runs, and is checked, with nothing installed; a real client
 * implements the same shape over a WebSocket and changes nothing above it.
