     * with a comment saying so. A terminal speaking the kitty protocol or
     * xterm's `modifyOtherKeys` sends the two apart and `ctrl+m` arrives as
     * itself; everywhere else it cannot, and no binding here can change that.
     * It is kept for the terminals that can, and it is not the one to
     * document.

     * decoder reads as alt+the key - so it works over SSH, in tmux and on a
     * console that has never heard of the kitty protocol. Global, because
     * nothing types it.

     * while the composer holds them - the same bargain `c`, `s` and `t`
