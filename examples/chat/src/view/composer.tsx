/**
 * What you type, and one line saying what it will be sent as.
 *
 * The field itself is `TextArea` from the catalog - growing, scrolling and
 * giving back the keys it does not want is not a chat problem. What is here is
 * the rest of a composer: what enter means while a turn is running, the slash
 * menu over what has already been typed, and the control row.
 *
 * The row used to be four ghost buttons naming their own keys - `send enter`,
 * `newline alt+enter`, `stop ctrl+c`, `commands ctrl+p` - which spent the one
 * line under the field on a keyboard legend. The keys belong in the footer,
 * which already lists them and changes with where the focus is. The line under
 * the field is worth more as *what is about to happen*: which harness, which
 * model, what it may do without asking, where it runs.
