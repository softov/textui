/**
 * What this conversation *is*, at the top of it.
 *
 * The first thing in the transcript rather than a band above it, and that is
 * the whole design: a caption pinned outside the scrolling region costs a row
 * of the conversation on every screen for ever, so it has to earn each one -
 * which meant one line, which meant dropping most of what it is for. Scrolled
 * with the conversation it costs nothing after the first screen and can say
 * everything, the way the top of a printed letter does.
 *
 * The identifiers are the point. They are what gets pasted into a shell or a
 * bug report, they are exactly what does not fit anywhere else, and the
 * catalogue's detail pane - the only other place they appear - is a screen
 * away from the conversation they belong to.
